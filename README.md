# Uncertainty: Software Artifacts

Here we provide the software artifacts of our work on introducing uncertainty in OCL/UML software datatypes. In particular, we provide:

* The extended version of USE tool which includes uncertain datatypes as primitive types.
* The OCL/UML, Java and MagicDraw libraries with the specification and implementation of the uncertain datatypes and their operations as well as several case studies are available from our Git repository.
